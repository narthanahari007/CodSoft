# CODSOFT

During my Data Science internship with CODSOFT, I had the opportunity to work on three distinct and insightful projects that enhanced my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and predictive modeling.

### Titanic Survival Prediction: 
I started with a classic machine learning project, using the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival. This project involved analyzing demographic and ticket data to build a classification model that could accurately predict whether a passenger would survive based on various factors such as age, gender, and ticket class. This task strengthened my understanding of preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation.

### Iris Flower Classification: 
Next, I worked on the well-known Iris dataset, focusing on classifying different species of Iris flowers based on their measurements. This project introduced me to classification algorithms and helped me grasp the fundamentals of supervised learning. I built a model that could distinguish between the setosa, versicolor, and virginica species with high accuracy.

### Sales Prediction Using Python: 
Lastly, I took on a real-world problem of sales prediction. I built a machine learning model that forecasts product sales by analyzing data related to advertising, customer segmentation, and other influencing factors. This task allowed me to apply predictive modeling techniques in Python, helping businesses optimize their advertising strategies and make informed decisions to drive sales growth.

Throughout these tasks, I gained hands-on experience with data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation techniques. Each project challenged me to apply my knowledge creatively and practically, resulting in an enriching learning experience that prepared me for real-world data science challenges.

I documented each of these projects in a GitHub repository and created a demo video to showcase my work, which is available on LinkedIn for peer review and feedback.
